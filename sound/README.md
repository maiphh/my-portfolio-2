# Sound Files for Portfolio

This directory contains sound effects used in the portfolio website.

## Required Sound Files

1. `hover.mp3` - A subtle hover sound for interactive elements (short, 20-50ms)
2. `click.mp3` - A click sound for buttons and links (short, 50-100ms)
3. `midnight-daydreams-250159.mp3` - Background music file

## Sound Recommendations

For the hover sound, choose something very subtle and short like:
- A soft tick
- A gentle whoosh
- A quiet tap

For best user experience:
- Sounds should be short (under 100ms)
- Low volume (already adjusted in code)
- MP3 format with small file size
